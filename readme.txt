Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]
Python offers a rich ecosystem of packages held within The Python Package Index (PyPI). With Python, users can build modules for the ever-growing PyPi library.  Users of this giant third-party package library can find tools to help them with projects ranging from AI to web development and more.- FlactuateTech[32]
